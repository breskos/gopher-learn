# Analysis

*State: In concept*

This module acts as helper for the encoders and the for the evaluation of a data set.

## Functionalities (planned)

- Correlation, *Similarities* between vectors, frames and matrixes
- Statistical measures on vectors and matrixes
- Information gain, entropy
- Bucketization of dimensions to determine how well a feature helps with classification
