# Input generator for online Learning

Abstract: In this task a generator generates random data points but with data that can easily be discriminated by the network.

## Example

After starting the example, the generator runs and produces data points for a 2-class problem.
With this we want to show that the network is able to learn from stream data with adapting itself.

Execute the example using the following command:

```
> go run main.go
```
